## Running the Project

#### Note: This project can run standalone with data saved locally. Manual backup is required when switching devices; this does not affect normal usage.

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run TypeWords is using Docker:

```bash
# Pull the image from Docker Hub
docker pull zyronon/typewords:latest

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name typewords zyronon/typewords:latest
```

Then open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access the project.

Or use Docker Compose:

```bash
# Start with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d

# Stop the service
docker-compose down
```

Or build and run locally:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t typewords .

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name typewords typewords
```

### Option 2: Running from Source

This project is built with `Nuxt` and requires a Node.js environment.
